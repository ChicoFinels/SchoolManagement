<p>A basic web application for school management developed while I was studying the database first approach.</p>

## üìù Contents

- .NET 9
- ASP.NET Core MVC
- Entity Framework Core - Database First
- Auth0
- Bootstrap & jQuery libraries

## üíª Prerequisites

Before you start, I recommend:
- Install the latest version of Visual Studio
- Install the latest version of SQL Server and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio

## ‚òï Using School Management

<p>Since this project uses the Database First approach, you have to run the SQL script present in this repository to generate the database.</p>
<p>If you want to add something else to the script, you need to run a new database scaffold to update your models, here is an example of the command:</p>

```csharp
Scaffold-DbContext "Name=ConnectionStrings:SchoolManagementDb" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir Data -Force -NoOnConfiguring 
```

><p>You can find out more about the Scaffold-DbContext parameters <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/powershell#scaffold-dbcontext">here</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can install <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ErikEJ.EFCorePowerTools">EF Core Power Tools</a> to make this process easier. With this extension you don't have to type the above command with all those parameters, with just a few clicks you get the result you desire.</p>

<p>The authentication of the application is done through a third-party service, Auth0, so in order to authenticate, you will need to have an Auth0 account and configure it with the help of the guides provided by Auth0.</p>
<p>Once the configuration is complete, you will need to replace the Auth0 data in this project's appsettings file with your own data and you will be able to authenticate to the application with the users you created in Auth0.</p>
